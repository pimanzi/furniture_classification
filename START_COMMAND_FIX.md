# ðŸš¨ URGENT FIX - Start Command Path Error

## The Problem:
```
bash: line 1: ./start.sh: No such file or directory
```

## The Solution:
**Update Start Command in Render Dashboard:**

### Current (Wrong):
```
./start.sh
```

### Correct:
```
./deploy/start.sh
```

## How to Fix:
1. Go to **Render Dashboard**
2. Select your **furniture-classification-app**
3. Go to **Settings**
4. Find **Start Command**
5. Change from `./start.sh` to `./deploy/start.sh`
6. Click **Save Changes**
7. **Manual Deploy** (or push a new commit)

## Alternative Quick Fix:
Create a start.sh in root directory that calls the deploy script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
./deploy/start.sh
```

But updating the Render dashboard is the cleaner solution.
